Welcome to my Remote Sensing portfolio. This folder contains projects where I analyze satellite imagery to study the environment.

### [1. Burn Severity Analysis (NBR / dNBR)](./Burn-Severity-Analysis-NBR-dNBR)
* **Goal:** To map and measure the damage caused by wildfires.
* **Method:** I used **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery. I calculated the **NBR** (Normalized Burn Ratio) and **dNBR** (Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) indices.
* **Tools:** Python, Satellite Imagery Analysis.

### [2. Land Use Classification (Supervised vs Unsupervised)](./Land-Use-Land-Cover-Classification-Supervised-vs-Unsupervised)
* **Goal:** To classify different types of land (like forests, water, and urban areas) on a map.
* **Method:** I compared two different methods to see which one is more accurate:
    * **Supervised Classification:** Done using Google Earth Engine (GEE).
    * **Unsupervised Classification:** Done using ArcGIS.
* **Tools:** Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS Pro.
