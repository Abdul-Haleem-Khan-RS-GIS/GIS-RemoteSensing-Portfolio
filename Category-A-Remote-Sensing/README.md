# 🛰️ Category A: Remote Sensing Projects

Welcome to my Remote Sensing portfolio. This folder showcases my ability to process and analyze satellite imagery for environmental monitoring. I use advanced tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS to turn raw data into meaningful maps.

## 📂 Projects in this Category

### [1. Burn Severity Analysis (NBR / dNBR)](./Burn-Severity-Analysis-NBR-dNBR)
* **Project Goal:** To identify areas damaged by wildfires and measure how severe the burn is.
* **Methodology:**
    * I accessed **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery.
    * I calculated the **NBR** (Normalized Burn Ratio) for pre-fire and post-fire images.
    * I created a **dNBR** (Differenced NBR) map to classify burn severity levels (Low, Moderate, High).
* **Key Skills:** Python scripting, Spectral Indices, Change Detection.

### [2. Land Use & Land Cover Classification](./Land-Use-Land-Cover-Classification-Supervised-vs-Unsupervised)
* **Project Goal:** To create a classified map showing vegetation, water, urban areas, and barren land.
* **Methodology:** I performed a comparative analysis of two methods:
    1.  **Supervised Classification (GEE):** Training a machine learning classifier to identify land types automatically.
    2.  **Unsupervised Classification (ArcGIS):** Grouping pixels based on spectral properties without training data.
* **Key Skills:** Image Classification, Google Earth Engine, Accuracy Assessment.
