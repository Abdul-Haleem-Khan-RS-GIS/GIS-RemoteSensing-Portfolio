# 🛰️ Category A: Remote Sensing Projects

Welcome to my Remote Sensing portfolio. This folder contains projects where I analyze satellite imagery to study the environment.

I use tools like **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, **ArcGIS**, and **QGIS** to process data from satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat.

## 📂 Projects in this Category

### 1. Burn Severity Analysis (NBR / dNBR)
* **Goal:** To map and measure the damage caused by wildfires.
* **Method:** I used **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery. I calculated the **NBR** (Normalized Burn Ratio) and **dNBR** (Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) indices to see which areas were burned and how severely.
* **Tools:** Python, Satellite Imagery Analysis.

### 2. Land Use & Land Cover Classification (Supervised vs. Unsupervised)
* **Goal:** To classify different types of land (like forests, water, and urban areas) on a map.
* **Method:** I compared two different methods to see which one is more accurate:
    * **Supervised Classification:** Done using Google Earth Engine (GEE).
    * **Unsupervised Classification:** Done using ArcGIS.
* **Tools:** Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS Pro.
