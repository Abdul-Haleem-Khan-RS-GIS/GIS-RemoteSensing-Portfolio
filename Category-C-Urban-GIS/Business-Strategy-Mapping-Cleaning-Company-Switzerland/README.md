# Business Strategy Mapping: Client & Employee Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project used **GIS technology** to help a cleaning company in Switzerland optimize its operations. The goal was to analyze where clients are located versus where employees live to improve service efficiency.

By mapping these two groups, the company could see "clusters" of activity and decide the best way to assign workers to specific areas.

## 🗺️ Visualization Strategy
I created a detailed map using specific symbols to make the data easy to read:
* **🔴 Red Circles:** Represent Clients.
* **🔵 Blue Circles:** Represent Employees.
* **Circle Size:** The size of the circle changes based on the number of people in that area (larger circle = more people).

## 🎯 Business Value
* **Service Optimization:** Identified gaps where there were many clients but few employees.
* **Strategic Planning:** Helped the organization decide where to hire new staff or how to redraw service zones.
* **Visual Insight:** Converted a complex list of addresses into a clear, easy-to-understand map for decision-makers.

## 🛠️ Skills Used
* **GIS Analysis:** Spatial clustering and location analysis.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating proportional symbol maps (varying circle sizes).
* **Strategic Consulting:** Using spatial data to solve business problems.
