# Employment Density Analysis: Dübendorf City

## 📌 Project Overview
This project maps the economic heartbeat of **Dübendorf City, Switzerland**. The goal was to visualize where jobs are concentrated to help urban planners and businesses understand the city's economic landscape.

By combining business data with transportation networks, I created a map that shows exactly where the employment "hotspots" are.

## 🗺️ Visualizing the Economy
Here is the final Employment Density Map. The darker/brighter areas represent higher concentrations of jobs:

## 📊 Methodology
To create this map, I integrated several different types of data:
* **Business Locations:** Where companies and industrial zones are located.
* **Demographics:** Where the workforce lives.
* **Infrastructure:** Transport networks and land use types.

## 🛠️ GIS Analysis Techniques
I used **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** to perform advanced spatial analysis:
* **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):** I used this technique to create a "heatmap" surface. It smooths out the point data to show the intensity of employment in different regions.
* **Proximity Analysis:** I analyzed how close these job clusters are to train stations and bus stops.

## 🔑 Key Features
* **🔥 Hotspots & Clusters:** Easily identifies the main business districts.
* **🚆 Accessibility:** Shows how well-connected job centers are to public transport.
* **🏗️ Land Use Overlay:** Compares economic activity with the official city zoning plans.
* **📈 Future Development:** Helps identify under-utilized areas that have potential for growth.
