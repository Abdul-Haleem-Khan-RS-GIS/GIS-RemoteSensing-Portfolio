# Zurich Daycare Center Map: Spatial Accessibility

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a meticulously crafted map that showcases **every daycare center (Kita)** in Zurich City, Switzerland.

The goal was to provide a comprehensive view of childcare availability across the city. By plotting every location, we can easily see which neighborhoods are well-served and which might need more facilities.

## 🗺️ Visualizing Childcare Access
Here is the detailed map. The **red dots** represent daycare centers, set against a detailed background of the city's buildings and roads:
