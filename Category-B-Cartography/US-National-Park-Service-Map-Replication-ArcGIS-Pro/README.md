# Replicate & Improve U.S. National Park Service Map

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced cartography and visual design. The goal was to replicate the iconic map style of the **U.S. National Park Service (NPS)** using **ArcGIS Pro**, while making subtle improvements to color and layout.

I focused on the **Rocky Mountain National Park** to create a map that is not only accurate but also visually beautiful and easy for visitors to read.

## 🗺️ Map Visualization
Here is the final map design, featuring the distinct NPS visual style:

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Style Replication:** Accurately recreating the standardized symbols, fonts, and colors used by the US National Park Service.
* **Design Improvement:** Refining the color palette and label placement to improve readability for hikers and tourists.
* **Topography:** integrating hillshade and terrain data to show the mountains clearly without cluttering the map.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Software:** ArcGIS Pro
* **Key Skills:**
    * **Advanced Cartography:** Custom symbology and labeling.
    * **Digital Mapping:** Managing complex layers (roads, trails, rivers).
    * **Data Visualization:** Presenting geographic data in a user-friendly way.
    * **Object-Relational Mapping:** Organizing spatial data for efficient rendering.
